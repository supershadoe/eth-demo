## eth-demo

An DApp created using Svelte 3, Tailwind/DaisyUI and Metamask API to interact with a basic shopping cart service hosted using
a smart contract written in [Solidity/Hardhat](https://github.com/chidam333/econEth/blob/542935b5e6fecc3645d43a1f499ed4b341506cef/contracts/shopping.sol)

This was created for a workshop during E-summit '23 to teach participants how to create a smart contract and use it in a webapp.

### How to run
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
- To deploy, add an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) and build using `npm run build`
- Deploy it by following your hosting platform's instructions

> Note: Use `adapter-static` to build for GitHub pages
